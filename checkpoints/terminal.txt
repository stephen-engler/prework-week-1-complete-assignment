# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
It checks the state of the directory you are in, whether it is ahead of the main
branch or not.  This will be the case if you've made changes since the last commit.
It also checks to see if the file or directory is ready for a commit after adding
it to the staging area with the git add . command.  It will also tell you if it
is in the staging area or not and ready for the next commit.  Finally it can tell you that
the commit was successful and that the files in your repository are up to date with
the files on your computer.

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
It tells git that you want to save changes to the particular file
or directory that you are working on.
If you haven't shown git the file yet, you need to use the command git init.
This tells git that this is a new file that you want to make commits for and track.
After that then you can use the command git add . to get the file ready for a commit
and move it into the staging area.
Finally the command for the actual commit is git commit -m "this is a commit message".
This saves this version of the file to your computer, and will still be available
if you make any further changes to it or more commits of the file.

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
git push - u origin master
